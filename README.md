##This is a demo app that displays info about a spefic artist (as rendered from an API call to a dummy server), and allows for a click through to the Amazon.com website to purchase various albums by the artist.


##Demo can be started by cloning this repo and running and npm install followed by the command 'react-native run-ios'

Thank you to Stephen Grider for his Udemy course 'The Complete React Native and Redux Course' which provided the guidance for the flow of the framework.

*note: demo assumes user has some basic knowledge of react-native's simulator and has also installed this library*
